# Elixir Cheatsheet

## Hello World!

The following code will print "Hello World!"

```elixir
IO.puts("Hello World!")
```

## Variables

Elixir allows you to assign to a variable more than once. If you want to match against the value of a previously assigned variable, you should use ^

```elixir
a = 12
b = 13.0
a + b
```

```elixir
a = 12
^a = 12
```
